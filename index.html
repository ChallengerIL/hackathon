                            <p>The Hebrew word “Aliyah” literally means ascent or rise, but for generations it has been used to mean “immigration to Israel.” Israel has always been the center of the Jewish universe, but for centuries the dream of moving to Israel was just that, a dream.</p>


                               <p> In the 1880s, organized groups began to immigrate to Israel with the goal of building communities and settling the land. “Aliyah” became the official term for immigration to Israel when, in 1950, the State of Israel opened her doors to the Jews of the world and passed the Law of Return.</p>

                                Repatriation to Israel does not mean burning all bridges. It is not always possible to complete all cases in the country of origin.

                                The "housing problem" plays a very important role in our life. This issue is especially acute immediately after repatriation to Israel, when you need to find your first home. To sign a rental agreement in Israel, you will need a checkbook, a teudat zehut, and possibly a guarantor.

After this period or earlier, you can exchange a driver's license for an Israeli model (if the driving experience is more than 5 years) simply by appearing at the Ministry of Transport with teudat zeut, teudat ole, the rights of the country of origin (you need to make their notarized translation into Hebrew), a green form ( tofes is bright), and also by paying a fee.
